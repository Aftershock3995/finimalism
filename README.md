Minimalist Jellyfin Theme CSS

Import to your CSS with

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@main/finimalism1-1.css");

```
As far as Client / Web UI settings go, under "Display", Backdrops are enabled. Under "Home", the order is My Media (small), Continue Watching, Next Up.

The accent color is set to [123,108,198] to match the Jellyfin logo.

Other than that, everything is just an alteration of the amazing work already put into Ultrachromic by CTalvio.
