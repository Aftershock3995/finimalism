Step 1: Import to your CSS with

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@main/finimalism7.css");

```

or if you don't want all the lovely colours... 

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@main/finimalism-just-black.css");

```

Step 2: In Jellyfin Client / Web UI Settings, under "Display", the Theme is set to Dark and Backdrops are enabled.

Everything is just an alteration of the amazing work already put into [Ultrachromic by CTalvio](https://github.com/CTalvio/Ultrachromic). Updated for jellyfin server 10.9.X
