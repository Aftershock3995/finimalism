Minimalist Jellyfin Theme CSS (final as of 2.3)

Import to your CSS with

```css
@import url("https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/tedhinklater/finimalism@main/finimalism2-3.css");

```
As far as Client / Web UI settings go, under "Display", Backdrops are enabled. Under "Home", the order is My Media (small), Continue Watching, Next Up. In the Movies/TV Shows gallery, Select View is set to Poster.

The accent color is set to [168,94,198] to match the Jellyfin logo.

Other than that, everything is just an alteration of the amazing work already put into Ultrachromic by CTalvio.

Also fixed some bugs such as Live TV cards being blurred by the progress overlay.

I'm going to leave the css box alone now.
